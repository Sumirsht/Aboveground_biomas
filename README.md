# Aboveground_biomas
R Markdown for Aboveground Biomass
In this example, we will use linear regression model to predict aboveground biomass using dbh and total tree height. the data is derive from paper which contain, foliage (fol), Branch (bch), stem bark (brk), stem wood (stm), and total aboveground biomass(tab) along with diameter at breast height (dbh), live crown length (lcl), and total tree height (tht).

This script performs Aboveground Biomass modelling using various linear models in R.
